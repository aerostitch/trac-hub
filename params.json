{"name":"Trac-hub","tagline":"Converts trac tickets to github issues.","body":"**trac-hub** converts [trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) tickets into github\r\nissues. To this end, it accesses trac's underlying database and copies over\r\nmilestones, creates tickets, and replays the change history of each ticket.\r\n\r\nSynopsis\r\n--------\r\n\r\nCopy the [example YAML configuration](https://github.com/mavam/trac-hub/blob/master/config.yaml.example) and adapt it as\r\nneeded:\r\n\r\n    cp config.yaml.example config.yaml\r\n    vim config.yaml\r\n\r\nThereafter just invoke `trac-hub`:\r\n\r\n    ./trac-hub\r\n\r\nBy default, trac-hub assumes the file `config.yaml` in the same directory as\r\nthe script. You can also specify the configuration file on the command line:\r\n\r\n    ./trac-hub -c foo.yaml\r\n\r\nAdd the `-v` flag for more verbose output:\r\n\r\n    ./trac-hub -v\r\n\r\nTo resume the migration at a given trac ticket ID, use `-s`:\r\n\r\n    ./trac-hub -s 42\r\n\r\n*Note*: when converting your trac setup to github, it is prudent to first try\r\nthe migration into a test repository which you can delete afterwards. If this\r\nworked out fine and delivered the expected results, one can still aim the\r\nscript at the real repository.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe YAML configuration file contains four sections. The section `trac` includes\r\nall trac-related configuration options. At this point trac-hub only supports\r\nSQLite, but it would be trivial to add PostgreSQL and MySQL support.\r\n\r\nThe section `github` includes your github login credentials and the repository\r\nin which to migrate. Note that all issues and comments will use the provided\r\nusername.\r\n\r\nThe section `labels` allows for custom label mappings. Since github's issue\r\ntracker does not have a first-class notion of ticket priority, type, and\r\nversion information, trac-hub supports expressing these in the form of labels. \r\n\r\nThe section `users` contains a one-to-one mapping between trac usernames and\r\ngithub usernames. Each github username must be an authorized collaborator with\r\npush privileges; trac-hub ignores unauthorized mappings.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\ntrac-hub comes with a [BSD-style licence](https://github.com/mavam/trac-hub/blob/master/COPYING).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
